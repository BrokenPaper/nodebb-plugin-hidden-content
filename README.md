## General

Markdown syntax is based on ideas from [CommonMark Talk](http://talk.commonmark.org/t/what-could-a-spoiler-tag-extension-look-like/767) group.

This is true `spoiler` implementation where spoiler content is not loaded on the page (loading on demand or "lazy loading").
## Styling

If you want to alter look of the spoiler, you could use these CSS classes: 

- `ns-spoiler` 
- `ns-spoiler-control` 
- `ns-spoiler-content`
